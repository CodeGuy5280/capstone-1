# ðŸ’° Account Ledger CLI Application

This Java-based **Account Ledger** is a command-line application that allows users to record and track financial transactions such as **deposits** and **payments**, and view summaries and reports based on those transactions.

Built in Java, the app uses:
- `ArrayList<Transaction>` to store data in memory
- CSV file for persistent storage
- Java `LocalDate` and `LocalTime` for timestamping
- Robust input validation and formatting
